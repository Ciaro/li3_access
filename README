Access library for the Lithium framework for PHP 5.3.

Example Usage
==============
Check out into your libraries directory.
Include the library in your /app/bootstrap/libraries.php file with:

Libraries::add('li3_access');


Add to your bootstrap process the config, for example:

use li3_access\security\Access;
Access::config(array(
    'rule_based' => array(
        'adapter' => 'Rules',
        // optional filters applied to check() method
        'filters' => array(
            function($self, $params, $chain) {
                // any config can define filters to do some stuff
                return $chain->next($self, $params, $chain);
            }
        )
    )
));


Then you can make a call to check acces (say in a controller) like so:

$access = Access::check('rule_based', Auth::check('configname'), $this->request);
if(!empty($access) {
    $this->redirect($access['redirect']);
}


The Access::check() method will always return an array. It will be empty if access is granted and will contain some data if denied. This array should contain a "message" key that explains why access was denied as well as a "redirect" key.
However, the array can contain any additional data that the adapter may choose to put in it.
You may also wish to call Access::check() from a different point in your application than the controller.

See the Rules adapter for a simple example of an adapter and more information including information about the add() method.
Note: The above example assumes you're using Lithium's Auth class to obtain user data.
Also Note: To call methods from the adapter that are not in the Access class, you will need to access it like so:

Access::adapter('rule_based')->add();
